# Web-Scraping-2
Extracting web links based on position and deep linking

It's an another similar web scraping code in python.
It simply enters the link in a certain position in a web page. And reenters the inner link unitl the count you entered is reached.

For example:
          If you entered 3 and 4. The code enters the third link in the web page and go into the link and inside that link again enters the third link in the webpage. And this is done 4 times repetedly. And returns the last link at the end of the code.
